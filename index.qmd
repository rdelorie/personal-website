# Hi, Iâ€™m Rachel ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my personal website. Iâ€™m a 3rd year student at Colorado State University studying Ecosystem Science and Sustainability. I'm originally from the seacoast of New Hampshire, but came out to Colorado for school. I am interested in environmental compliance, GIS, ornithology, and restoration.
