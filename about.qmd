I am a 4th year student at Colorado State University studying Ecosystem Science and Sustainability, graduating with my Bachelors of Science in May 2026 and Professional Science Masters in May 2027. I am deeply committed to the conservation of the natural world, with a focus in addressing the challenges of climate change through collaborative, community-driven solutions. I am pursuing a career in environmental science because I want to make a positive, lasting impact on our planet.
