# About Me

Iâ€™m a 4th year student at Colorado State University studying Ecosystem Science and Sustainability. I'm originally from the seacoast of New Hampshire, but came out to Colorado for school. I am interested in environmental compliance, GIS, ornithology, and restoration.

Here is a picture of me hiking outside of Leadville, CO!
