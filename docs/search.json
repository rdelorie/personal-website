I collected the data, years and places my grandmother has traveled, then joined it to a world countries polygons layer. I then used creative style packages and techniques from John Nelson, Esri cartographer, to create the following. I will be collecting feedback and improving this map Fall 2025.\n\n\nWhat‚Äôs Next\nFall of 2025 I will be taking NR450, Geospatial Project Design and Analysis, where I will develop and execute an independent project on wildlife habitat fragmentation due to oil and gas infrastructure in Weld County, Colorado."
