    "text": "World Travel\nWhen given the opportunity to “choose my own geospatial adventure” in NR 493, Seminar on GIS and Remote Sensing Applications, I decided to fine tune my cartography skills and create a product that is both informational and visually appealing. I collected the data, years and places my grandmother has traveled, then joined it to a world countries polygons layer. I then used creative style packages and techniques from John Nelson, Esri cartographer, to create the following. I will be collecting feedback and improving this map Fall 2025."
